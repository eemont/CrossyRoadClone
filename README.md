# CrossyRoadClone

Description: Recreation of the classic Crossy Road game using the Unreal 5 Engine. Assets created using Magica Voxel.

## OBJECT OF THE GAME:
 - Live as long as possible. There is only one level, but it is dynamic and
keeps being created in front of you, and destroyed behind you.
- The level is made up of alternating safe areas and obstacles with either
vehicles that can strike you, or water you can fall into.
- Safe areas are grass w/ trees, bushes, and rocks). Obstacles are roads w/ vehicles, RR's w/ trains, or rivers w/
water (unsafe) and moving logs (temporarily safe)). You can move forwards/right/left always, and backwards
only within a single safe area/obstacle. (However, most safe areas are only one jump wide.)
- Obstacles consist of moving cars/trucks, trains, or logs so that it is always possible
for the player to get through if they are clever enough. This means that cars/trucks/trains must be timed, and
trees/bushes/ stumps/rocks must be placed properly.
- The player can be killed by being run over, or by running
into the side of a car/truck/train, or by falling into a river.
